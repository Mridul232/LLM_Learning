Thank you for your interest in contributing to this learning repository. This project contains sandboxed, sanitized examples used for personal learning and demonstration.

Guidelines
- Keep commits small and focused. Provide a clear commit message.
- Do not add any secrets or personal data (API keys, passwords, CVs with PII) to the repository.
- If you add new examples, include a short description, expected inputs and how to run them.
- Prefer minimal reproducible examples and include required dependencies in `learning/requirements.txt`.

Pull Requests
1. Fork the repository and create a feature branch from `main`.
2. Make your changes and run tests or a quick smoke check.
3. Open a Pull Request describing your change and link any relevant resources.

Code style
- Use clear, readable code and sensible variable names.
- Add inline comments where logic is non-obvious.

Security policy
- If you discover a secret accidentally committed, notify the repo owner and do not open a PR containing the secret. The owner will rotate the secret and remove it from history.
